# Fountain Parser RS

This library is for parsing [Fountain](https://fountain.io/syntax/)-formatted plain text files.

This provides the ability to categorize a Fountain-formatted screenplay so it may be rendered into a PDF, or otherwise displayed in a coherent manner.

## Status

This parser is partially functional. See the tests in `lib.rs`.

## Special Thanks

This parser has been adapted from the parsing code for [Beat](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat) by Lauri-Matti Parppei. It would not be possible without that.

Thank you, Lauri!
